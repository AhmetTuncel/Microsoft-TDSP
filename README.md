# Team Data Science Process from Microsoft
This repository contains the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP) from Microsoft**. 
TDSP is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and tools for productive data science. 

This is still an **early preview**. Check back here often to see new developments in this space. We would love to hear from you regarding TDSP. 
Feel free to start a discussion on this Github repo [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/issues) area.
