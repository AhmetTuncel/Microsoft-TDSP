This repository contains the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP) from Microsoft**. 
TDSP is an agile, iterative, data science methodology to improve collaboration and team learning. It is supported through a lifecycle definition, standard project structure, artifact templates, and tools for productive data science. 

## Release Notes

This is an **early preview** release of TDSP. We are continuously improving TDSP based on our further accumulated experience, and customer feedback. Stay tuned for future releases. 

## Ask Questions. 

We would love to hear back from you. Should you have any questions or suggestions, please create an issue at [TDSP/Issues](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/issues)

## Make TDSP Better, Together

We believe that with the help of the data science community, TDSP can be more efficient, and can benefit more enterprises and more data scientists. We warmly welcome you to contribute to TDSP, either on TDSP documentation or on workflow design. 

If you know some better tools for versioning or work items management, feel free to contribute pages at [TDSP/wiki](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/wiki). If you have some useful data science utilities to share, we encourage you to contribute to 
the [TDSP-Utilities Github repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-Utilities).
